# torrent-tracker-queryer
A script that iterates through a .txt ip list, and checks for Torrent activity through Torrent trackers.
<br />
<br />
This script was originally made to keep bad IP's from connecting to a server. Hence the reason why the script looks so broken up and messy as it was taken in chunks and put back together.

Features
============
[1] **Colorized terminal output**
<br />
<br />
[2] **Flagging once Torrent activity was found on the iterated IP.**
<br />
<br />
[3] **Flagging RED once an IP has been involved in watching / downloading child pornography.**
<br />
<br />
[4] **Once all IP's in the list have been scanned, all IP's that were found to have Torrent activity will be shown once more in colorized order depending on normal activity / pornography activity / child pornography activity.**
